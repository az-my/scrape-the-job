Certainly, here's a breakdown of what the script does and its limitations:

**What the Script Does:**

The script performs the following tasks:

1. Automatically runs every day at 00:01 AM WIB (Western Indonesian Time).
2. Retrieves job postings from a well-known job portal.
3. Searches for job postings with specific keywords, including job titles like "Data-Analyst," "Data-Analis," "Data-Engineer," "ETL-Developer," "Power-BI-Developer," "Business-Intelligence," "Business-Intelligence Analyst," "Business-Analyst," "Bisnis-Analis," "BI Analyst," and "BI-Developer."
4. Compares the job role name for each posting to check if it matches any of the specified keywords.
5. Flags job postings where the job role name matches the keywords.
6. Filters and retains only the flagged job postings, indicating a match between the job role name and the specified keywords.

**Limitations of the Script:**

1. The script is limited to working with the specific set of keywords mentioned above.
2. It specifically targets job postings with the location listed as Indonesia.
3. The script must run daily at 00:01 AM WIB to function as intended.
4. It may not capture job postings that do not precisely match the predefined keywords, potentially missing out on relevant job listings.
5. It relies on the quality and accuracy of job postings and their location information, which can vary.

These limitations help define the scope and functionality of the script, focusing on specific job roles and location criteria.
