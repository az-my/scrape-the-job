What the Script Does:
The script is designed to accomplish the following tasks:
1.  Data Extraction: It scrapes job postings from the jobstreet.co.id website for the roles of Data Analyst and Data Engineer.
2.  Data Storage: The extracted job data is stored in two files, job_data.csv and job_data.json. These files are organized within a directory named "Data."
3.  Automation: The script is scheduled to run automatically at midnight.

To-Do List:
In the future, there are several potential improvements and expansions for this project:
1.  Data Presentation: Develop a frontend or a user-friendly interface to display the extracted job data in a visually appealing and easy-to-read format. This can enhance the data's readability and enable further analysis.
2.  Additional Data Sources: Consider extending the script's functionality to scrape job postings from other job search platforms such as Google Jobs, LinkedIn, Indeed, Kalibrr, Dealls, and more. Expanding data sources can provide a broader perspective on job opportunities.

By implementing these enhancements, the project can become a valuable tool for job seekers and data analysts seeking relevant job opportunities.
