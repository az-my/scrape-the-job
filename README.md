This script performs the following actions:

1. It first fetches job postings from a well-known job portal based on a list of predefined search terms or keywords. These search terms include job titles like "Data-Analyst," "Data-Engineer," "ETL-Developer," "Power-BI-Developer," "Business-Intelligence," "Business-Intelligence Analyst," "Business-Analyst," "Bisnis-Analis," "BI Analyst," and "BI-Developer."

2. Next, it compares the job role name for each job posting to see if it matches any of the keywords from the list. If there's a match, it flags the posting as a "Yes."

3. Finally, the script filters out and retains only the job postings that have been flagged as a "Yes," indicating that the job role name matches one of the specified keywords.

In summary, the script fetches job postings based on specific search terms, checks if the job role name matches any of these terms, and retains only the postings that have a match, helping to identify relevant job postings for further processing or analysis.
